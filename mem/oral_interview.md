Can you describe your favirate book?


I love reading novels among the novels I have readed, I like the Hemingway's old and sea most
I admire the old fisherman's will in the novel very much,he lets me understand that a person must have unremitting spirit,could succeed .What the novel is described is an old fisherman almost the sixty years old,when go to sea and fish alone once,have angled to a big fish,but can not draw.
Old fisherman's spirit that makes great efforts to struggle fearless of danger and difficulty that the novel has been extolled,we should be like him too,can' t be satisfied with the current situation ,should be positive upwards,it should be unremitting to do anything,it must not give up halfway to meeting difficulty should meet the difficulty.Only in this way,we could obtain greater success and victory .

With all his great experience and strength, he struggles with the fish for three days, admiring its strength, dignity, and faithfulness to its identity; its destiny is as true as Santiago’s as a fisherman. He finally reels the marlin in and lashes it to his boat.


We all have certain goals in life. Some of them are short term goals and some of them long term goals. It is the long term goals that define our lives. These goals are milestones to success. And they don’t come easily. They require every bit of our tenacious hard work, courage and confidence. Once achieved, these goals have the potential to change the course of our lives permanently. The only thing that matters in accomplishing and not accomplishing these goals is our ability to hold on. When we have the goal,we should put all our heart and soul into it, nobody can stop us from achieving it. Like the old man did. So I love this novel. That all, thank you.

A man bears pain and hardship without complaint.
A man is not made for defeat.
The topic of the whole story is:The person can not live for failure.A man can be destroyed,but not be defeated. That left the deepest impression on me.

Did the old man succeed? Maybe different people have different answers. But in my opinion, although the only thing the man took back was the skeleton of the big Marlin which seemed of no use, he was still the winner. Because whether a man is a winner or not doesn’t depend on how many he gets, but depends on how hard he works in order to reach his goal. And there’s no doubt that the man had tried his best. I do admire him from the bottom of my heart.
So I have to say, the old fisherman, Santiago, was a winner.
In the past, I asked myself some questions sometimes. If I am in trouble, will I be as brave as possible? If I have been very tired because of the trouble, will I keep trying and not give up until I reach my goal? Maybe it doesn’t matter what the answers were before. The thing which is much more important is how I will behave in the future.
A man can be destroyed but not defeated.
I will never forget what Santiago said.
The courage of the old man will inspire me from now on.
I am so sure I will gradually become the one who is brave and strong enough to face all difficulties without any fear.
Because the old fisherman, Santiago, had told me that everyone could be even power than you had ever imagined as long as he believed he could.

After reading The Old man and the Sea
It’s really a wonderful story about belief and courage.
The hero is Santiago, an old fisherman. For eighty-four days, he had not caught any fish. Everybody didn’t think the man has good luck. But the old man didn’t think so. He believed himself. He thought his skills will help him to have a big harvest. So, he still decided to go fishing at the eighty-fifth day. After the great efforts, Santiago indeed got a big Marlin. Of course you can imagine how excited he was. He tied the fish to the boat. And then he set foot on the way home .But unfortunately, the next things didn’t go well as we expect. The man encountered a series of difficulties. He had to fight with many kinds of sharks who came to eat the Marlin. Although the old man was very, very tired, he refused to give up. He just kept fighting. When he landed, the only thing of the big Marlin left is the skeleton.
