Good morning/afternoon professor,I'm very glad to be here. Thank you for having me. My name is fulj. I'm 32 years old.I am a focused and quick-learning Software Engineer with 8 years of experience in computer science, programming, and architecture design for various projects. My daily work include gathering user requirements, defining system functionality and writing code in various languages, like Java, Python,SQL, etc. I am very familiar with the software development life cycle (SDLC) from preliminary system analysis to tests and deployment.I am now working for iSoftStone as a software engineer for about one year. During this year I was assigned to Ali Cloud to develop RDS which is a stable, reliable, and scalable online database service. RDS is a biggest project I've ever seen. I learn a lot about engineering technology.For example, how to keep system reliable; How to manage a sea of components to work togather efficiently; How to CI/DI(Continuous integration and continuous delivery); The professional technology that I learned in my job has laid a solid foundation for me to better understand what I will learn in my postgraduate period.I believe I can do well in this major after my entrance, which will also help me to achieve my career goals.

Can you describe your hometown?

My hometown is a small county in the center of zhejiang pro which is sorrounded by clean water and green mountains.The air there is very fresh and very suitable for living.It is rich in the ecological tourism resources with the AAAA level tourist area of Xinhua mountain and 白石湾 and Tongji Lake and First Family of Southern China. Pujiang is also named as “County of Chinese Painting and Calligraphy” and “County of Chinese Folk Art.” The industry in Pujiang is varied, among which crystals and padlocks take up to 70% market sale, which makes Pujiang as the collecting and distributing center of crystal and padlocks in China. Thus it is named the “Crystal Capital” and “Padlock Center.”

That is my hometown pujiang county, and I love it so much.  Thank you
