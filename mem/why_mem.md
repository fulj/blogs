If you've ever wondered how a Master of Engineering Management(MEM) differs from a Master of Engineering, you're not alone. The main difference lies in the skills an MEM can provide.While an enineering degree will develop the skills necessary to become a high-perfoeming engineer, you may find yourself thrown into the deep end when it comes to managing a team and keeping projects on budget.

A MEM combines typical engineering skills with subjects more commonly found in an MBA program.It's kind of like an MBA for engineers. You'll learn how to handle complex business problems, take on leadership, manage stakeholder relationships, use emerging technology and ensure the financial viability of your projects.

**Develop sought-after skills**

Engineering management requires a set of highly technical skills coupled with emotional intelligence and team management skills. You'll also need to understand how to manage a project.Unlike a standard Master of Engineering,the MEM program provides you with an understanding of how to run a business.In a competitive market, these skills are invaluable.Emplyers are on the lookout for engineers who can not only do the work, but will also have a strong grasp of what goes on hehind the scenes in a business.

Having a practical business perspective on top of your engineering skills means that you'll be able to manage projects while keeping higher-level business needs in mind.This is a quality that prospective employers look for in candidates, the ability to do the work while meeting business targets.
