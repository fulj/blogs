Sorry madam, but that question is still beyond my knowledge now, I will make it clear soon after this interview, so could you change a question?

First of all, thanks for your question. It is a really good question. But it is little difficult for me because I have never thought about it. So I cannot answer this question at this very moment. But if I get admitted to MEM, I will find out the answer with my talented classmates and extraordinary professors.

Thank you for your question. It is a really good question. I know my English sucks and I cannot express my thoughts in the way I speak my mother tongue. But I will pay special attention to English learning whether I get admitted to MEM or not.
Then let me try to answer your question.


Well i like reading novels, if I have to choose a favorite, it must be the old man and sea.

It’s really a wonderful story about belief and courage.
The hero is Santiago, an old fisherman. For eighty-four days, he had not  caught any fish. Everybody didn’t think the man has good luck. But the old man didn’t think so. He believed himself. He thought his skills will help him to have a big harvest. So, he still decided to go fishing at the next day. After the great efforts, Santiago indeed got a big Marlin. Of course you can imagine how excited he was.But unfortunately, the next things didn’t go well as we expect. The man encountered a series of difficulties. He had to fight with many kinds of sharks who came to eat the Marlin. Although the old man was very, very tired, he refused to give up. He just kept fighting. When he landed, the only thing of the big Marlin left is the skeleton.
Did the old man succeed? Maybe different people have different answers. But in my opinion, a man is a winner or not doesn’t depend on how many he gets, but depends on how hard he works in order to reach his goal.So I have to say, the old fisherman, Santiago, was a winner.

In fact We all have certain goals in life. Some of them are short term goals and some of them long term goals. It is the long term goals that define our lives. These goals are milestones to success. And they don’t come easily. They require every bit of our tenacious hard work, courage and confidence. Once achieved, these goals have the potential to change the course of our lives permanently. The only thing that matters in accomplishing and not accomplishing these goals is our ability to hold on. Like the old man did. Never and ever give up.When we have the goal,we should put all our heart and soul into it, nobody can stop us from achieving it.

Can you describe your hometown?
My hometown pujiang is a small county in the center of zhejiang province which is sorrounded by clean water and green mountains.The air there is very fresh and very suitable for living.It is rich in the ecological tourism resources with the AAAA level tourist area of Xinhua mountain and 白石湾 and Tongji Lake and First Family of Southern China. Pujiang is also named as “County of Chinese Painting and Calligraphy” and “County of Chinese Folk Art.” The industry in Pujiang is varied, among which crystals and padlocks take up to 70% market sale, which makes Pujiang as the collecting and distributing center of crystal and padlocks in China. Thus it is named the “Crystal Capital” and “Padlock Center.”Also  My hometown has a lot of delicious food. And welcome to my hometown. Enjoy the beautiful scenery and taste the delicious food. That's all thanks.
